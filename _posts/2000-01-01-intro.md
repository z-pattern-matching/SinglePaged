The pattern matching is basically a `switch` on steroids, you can create powerful conditions such based on `Object` properties or `Array` content without manipulating the `Object` or `Array` itself. That amount of power leads you write functional, immutable, and expressive code instead imperative, which reduces a lot of complexity and bugs.


**Usage:**
- Install via npm: `npm install z`
- Require **z** in your code, you can use a beautiful name such "matches": `const matches = require('z')`

*Example: Matches by Object property*

~~~ javascript
const matches = require('z')

const person = { name: 'Maria' }
matches(person)(
  (x = { name: 'John' }) => console.log('John you are not welcome!'),
  (x)                    => console.log(`Hey ${x.name}, you are welcome!`)
)

//output: `Hey Maria, you are welcome!`
~~~

*Example: Matches by type or instances*

~~~ javascript
const matches = require('z')

const result = matches(1)(
  (x = 2)      => 'number 2 is the best!!!',
  (x = Number) => `number ${x} is not that good`,
  (x = Date)   => 'blaa.. dates are awful!'
)

console.log(result) // output: number 1 is not that good
~~~

*Example: matches Array content*

To match array content you need create multiple arguments for the match function, such as `(a, b, c, tail) => {}` , then each variable match each item from array. *Note:* last variable contains all remaining array items, formally named tail. Examples:

~~~ javascript
const matches = require('z')

matches([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])(
  (a, b, c, tail) => 'a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, tail = [4, 5]'  
)

matches([1, 2])(
  (a, tail) => 'a = 1, b = [2]'  
)

matches([1])(
  (a, b,  tail)      => 'Will not match here',
  (a = 2, tail = []) => 'Will not match here',
  (a = 1, tail)      => 'Will match here, b = []'
)
~~~

*Example: Powerful recursive code which will remove sequential repeated items from Array.*

Can be mind blowing if it's the first time you meet pattern matching, but you are gonna understand it!

~~~ javascript
const matches = require('z')

const compress = (numbers) => {
  return matches(numbers)(
    (x, y, xs) => x === y
      ? compress([x].concat(xs))
      : [x].concat(compress([y].concat(xs))),
    (x, xs) => x // stopping condition
  )
}

compress([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]) //output: [1, 2, 3]
