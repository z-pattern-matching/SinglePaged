# Available Patterns

*You can use any variable names, **x** for current element and **xs** for remaining elements is a wide used convention on functional programming*

- `() => {}` matches empty (array or string) eg.: [], ''
- `(x) => {}` matches an array with a single element eg.: [1], [[1, 2, 3]] (array with a single array), matches single character eg.: 'x' or matches a single number eg.:1
- `(x, xs) => {}` matches array with more than one element. First parameter is the first element (head), second is remaining elements (tail)
- `(x, y, xs) => {}` matches array with more than two elements. First parameter is the first element (head), second parameter is the second element, third are remaining elements (tail). You can specify more than 2 items eg.: (x, y, z, xs), (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, tail), etc...
- `function otherwise(){ }` matches everything else.

#### Rule of thumb: when the match has more than one parameter, the last parameter will be always the remaining elements of the array (tail).

# Patterns with value comparison

*NOTE: This is only available on ES6*

- `(x = 'some value')` matches if the element has the specified value. The value can be anything, such as array, number, string, null, undefined, etc...
- `(x, xs = [])` same match above but with tail. It can match any value as well.
